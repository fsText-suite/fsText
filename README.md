# Few Shot Text Classification

We aim to build an open-source library for few-shot text classification. 

*Use Case* : A user has a column of short texts (e.g user reviews) but those comments are not labeled. We ask the user to hand-label just a few texts for each class (i.e. few-shot), and provide a method that leverages pre-trained embeddings to generalize the classification.

This library will gather several state-of-the-art techniques. We will present the concepts behind each algorithm and its implementation in the section below.
